* Developed a sentiment analysis framework (RGCA-SA) leveraging RoBERTa embeddings and a neural network-based model to analyze text sentiment.

* Trained the model on popular movie sentiment analysis datasets such as IMDb, SST2, and MR, attaining accuracy scores of 93.25%, 91.05%, and 85.55% respectively, and achieved results comparable to models in SOTA (State of the Art) research papers.

* Conducted ablation analysis to validate the modelâ€™s effectiveness, showcasing its competitive performance in sentiment classification.

* Paper under review for publication. Will upload paper and source-code once published.

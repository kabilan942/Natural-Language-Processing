* To generate abstractive summaries for Indian Legal case judgement documents and comparing the performance of  different pre-trained and fine-tuned transformer based models using chunking-based approach on  Indian-Abstractive dataset prepared using Indian Supreme Court judgements.

* Experimented with various transformer based models (BARD, T5, Pegasus, BigBird)- pretrained & fine-tuned, with chunks of various sized to get intuition of their effect on performance of output of model and experience modeling them via coding.

* Compared the chunks generated by these models using metrics such as ROUGE recall, ROUGE f1, BLEU score, Euclidean, manhattan & cosine similarities

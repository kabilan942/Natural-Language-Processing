# Natural-Language-Processing

* These are the projects worked on during my year-long learning and subsequent internship in NLP at NIT Trichy. I worked mainly on sentiment analysis and text summarization (extractive & abstractive) tasks.

* Experimental Setup: During the course of internship, I had the opportunity to operate using an NVIDIA DGX-1 Server present in my college. This workstation comprises eight NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs, delivering exceptional GPU compute performance at 1 Petaflop and a total GPU memory capacity of 256 GB.

* This helped running the code on the complete (bigger) datasets as is the case with most NLP applications!

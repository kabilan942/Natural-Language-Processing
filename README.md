## Research-Work

### Legal/Transformers
* To generate abstractive summaries for Indian Legal case judgement documents. Comparing 
performance of different pre-trained and fine-tuned transformer-based models using 
chunking-based approach on Indian Abstractive dataset prepared using Indian Supreme Court 
judgements.

### Sentiment Analysis Binary Classification
* To perform binary classification on benchmark datasets for sentiment analysis and achieve results comparable to models in SOTA (State of the Art) research papers.

* Designed a model with Contextual Embeddings, CNN and Bi-GRU and utilized Keras & Tensorflow for model development and training. Achieved accuracy scores of 93.25 on IMDb, 91.05 on SST2 and 85.55 on MR datasets.

* Paper under review for publication. Will upload paper and source-code once published.

### Text Summarization
* To generate extractive summaries for the benchmark DailyMail dataset and achieve results comparable to models in SOTA research papers using ROUGE score as the metric to analyse the word matching in the summaries generated.

* Achieved ROUGE-1 F-Score of 0.3504 by designing a model to predict the saliency score (a measure of similarity of sentence to summary) of a sentence.

* Paper under review for publication. Will upload paper and source-code once published.

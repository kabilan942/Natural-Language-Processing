* To generate extractive summaries for the benchmark DailyMail dataset and achieve results comparable to models in SOTA research papers using ROUGE score as the metric to analyse the word matching in the summaries generated.

* Achieved ROUGE-1 F-Score of 0.3504 by designing a model to predict the saliency score (a measure of similarity of sentence to summary) of a sentence.

* Experimented with various techniques to calculate saliency score including BERTScore, BLEU score, various ROUGE metrics, etc.

* Got experience implementing different type of models - deep learning models with architecture with RNN (its variant - GRU, LSTM) & CNN, transformer-based models and hybrid techniques too.

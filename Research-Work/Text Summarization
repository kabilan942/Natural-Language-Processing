To generate extractive summaries for the benchmark DailyMail dataset and achieve results comparable to models in SOTA research papers using ROUGE score as the metric to analyse the word matching in the summaries generated.

Achieved ROUGE-1 F-Score of 0.3504 by designing a model to predict the saliency score (a measure of similarity of sentence to summary) of a sentence. 

Paper under review for publication. Will upload paper and source-code once published.
